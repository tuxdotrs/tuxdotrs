### üëã Hi, I'm tux 
I‚Äôm an independent programmer from India, fueled by open-source, automation, and building tools that click. I spend my days taming terminals and nights fragging in FPS matches. When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me exploring new places with my camera or chasing golden-hour light.

My zen? A perfectly tuned ```flake.nix```, the click of a mechanical keyboard, and freezing life‚Äôs fleeting moments into frames. Let‚Äôs chat about Linux sorcery, crypto bots, or FPS tactics!
